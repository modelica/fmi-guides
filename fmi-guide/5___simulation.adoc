== Simulation

=== Instantiation

Importing implementations must pass valid values into the following instantiation calls for all of their arguments:

* FMI 3.0: `fmi3InstantiateModelExchange`, `fmi3InstantiateCoSimulation`, and `fmi3InstantiateScheduledExecution`
* FMI 2.0: `fmi2Instantiate`
* FMI 1.0: `fmiInstantiate`, `fmiInstantiateSlave`

Note especially that null pointers are not valid for any of the string arguments to these functions, unless explicitly allowed.
Implementations must pass proper values especially for the following fields:

* `instanceName` must not be the null pointer, the empty string or a string only containing whitespace.
* `instantiationToken` (3.0), `fmuGUID` (2.0), and `GUID` (1.0)  must match the value of the `instantiationToken` (3.0) and `guid` (2.0/1.0) attribute from the modelDescription.xml file, respectively.
* For FMI 3.0, `resourcePath` must be a valid native path to the FMU's `resources` directory.
If an FMU has no `resources` directory or if no such path can be provided due to implementation restrictions the `resourcePath` argument must be a null pointer.
* For FMI 2.0/1.0 `fmuResourceLocation`/`fmuLocation/` must be a valid URI (per RFC 3986), and should be a URI with the `file` scheme, since that is currently the only scheme that is required to be supported by the FMU.
Note that the description of this in the FMI 1.0 standards is very unclear and confusing, so that in practice, until a proper cleanup version of the 1.0 standard is released, as far as valid URIs are concerned the implementation should follow the spirit of the rules as laid out in the FMI 2.0 standard for the fmuResourceLocation argument, but pointing to the root of the unpacked FMU archive rather than the resources directory.
Note also that `file://C:/` and similar are not valid file URIs, but should rather be supplied as either `file:///C:/` (empty authority) or as `file:/C:/` (missing authority) to be valid URIs.
Furthermore the validity of a URI is not influenced by the existence or non-existence of the file/directory pointed to, so that in the case of FMI 2.0, a URI pointing to the resources directory would still be a valid URI, even if the unpacked FMU archive did not contain a resources directory.
* `mimeType` (FMI 1.0 only) must not be null and must be a valid MIME type; unless specific requirements indicate otherwise, `application/x-fmu-sharedlibrary` is the proper string to pass here.

If an importer tries to create a second instance of an FMU with `canBeInstantiatedOnlyOncePerProcess == false`, the FMU should provide an error message and return `NULL`.

Exporting implementations should guard (by safely handling these cases without crashing) against common errors in calls to the instantiation functions, including:

* `instanceName`, `GUID`/`fmuGUID`/`instantiationToken`, `fmuLocation`/`fmuResourceLocation` and `mimeType` might all be null pointers or empty strings, or otherwise invalid,
* `GUID`/`fmuGUID`/`instantationToken` is possibly not the `guid`/`instantiationToken` attribute from the model description, but something else entirely (i.e. neither the guid attribute from this version of the FMU nor from a former version),
* Especially under FMI 1.0 `fmuLocation` is very likely not pointing to the right location (either pointing to the resources directory, or the root directory of the unzipped FMU, to the zipped FMU, or to a different directory entirely), or is an invalid URI (e.g. `file://C:/something` or the empty string) or of an unknown scheme.
This of course makes resource-loading difficult.
For Model Exchange FMUs (which are not passed an `fmuLocation` argument in any case) and for Co-Simulation FMUs (which often get these kinds of illegal/unclear URIs) as a fallback mechanism, it is recommended to load resources from paths derived from the location of the SharedObject/DLL for platforms that support this:
On Win32 for example this can be achieved through the use of `GetModuleFileName` with the `module_handle` of the DLL (as provided in a `DllMain` argument), or via `dladdr` on a known symbol in the FMU on OS X or Linux and similar ELF-based systems.
Note that this kind of mechanism should only be used as a fallback, if `fmuLocation` is not provided (ME FMUs) or is invalid in some way.

=== Initialization

When performing initialization of variable values, including parameters and initial values for other variables, importers should not rely on default values being already set in the FMU (i.e. burned into the binary so to speak):
While the FMI standards specify that default values shall both be specified in the `modelDescription.xml` file and are already set in the FMU upon instantiation, some implementations generate FMUs where this is not true, i.e. the default values of variables when not set do not match the values as specified in the `modelDescription.xml` file.
Since there is little effort in actually setting default values through the FMI API at initialization time, the more conservative approach is to always set default values through the API based on the modelDescription.xml file, or on the actual parameter/initial values as specified by the user, not relying on any burned in default values.

Exporting implementations must ensure that any default values specified for variables in the `modelDescription.xml` file are actually “burned in”:
The values shall be set automatically as default values upon FMU instantiation, so that importing implementations can rely on the standard-mandated behavior that unset variables have their default values as specified in the `modelDescription.xml`.

Importers should respect the different order of necessary function calls between FMI 1.0 and FMI 2.0/3.0 when performing initialization (this phase has seen larger changes between FMI 1.0 and 2.0/3.0 due to the introduction of explicit phases/modes in the FMI API, whereas these phases where only implicit in FMI 1.0).

=== Startup

For FMI 1.0 Co-Simulation FMUs importing implementations should honor the `canHandleEvents` capability of the FMU: If this capability attribute is false, then the implementation cannot call the `doStep` function with zero `communicationStepSize`, even at time 0 (used e.g. for generating valid initial values).
In those cases the integration environment must start simulation with the first simulation step, without any event iteration.
With FMI 2.0 Co-Simulation FMUs do not support 0-size time steps in any case.
With FMI 3.0, Co-Simulation FMUs can support event handling explicitly via the `hasEventMode` capability flag.
Importers can make use of this feature by passing `fmi3True` for the `eventModeUsed` argument of the `fmi3InstantiateCoSimulation` call.

=== Support for Solvers

Importing implementations should support a wide variety of solver algorithms, in order to support Model-Exchange FMUs as fully as possible.
Ideally this support should include support for attaching external solvers through specified APIs, so that experienced users can extend the supported solver base for specific new domains where appropriate.
Supporting the use of several different solvers in one model that integrates a number of FMUs, so that e.g. different Model Exchange FMUs can be solved through different solvers than other parts of the model – without resorting to Co-Simulation FMUs – can be beneficial in terms of performance and usability.

In any case the proper documentation of the employed solver algorithms and their configurable settings is very beneficial in understanding and handling differences between implementations.

Exporting implementations should offer all of their built-in solver algorithms (including solver settings like step-size, tolerance, etc.) for export when generating Co-Simulation FMUs, so that the same solvers can be used inside the environment as in exported FMUs.
This should ideally also include the ability to export Co-Simulation FMUs using user-supplied solvers, where appropriate (e.g. where the environment supports the integration of external solvers for model evaluation).

=== Support for Mixing FMUs Types

Importing implementations should support mixing FMUs of different types (and different FMI versions) in one simulation model, ensuring proper semantics for connections between those FMUs and each other as well as the rest of the simulation model.
This should also be checked in cross-checking with other implementations.

As a side issue, importing implementations should try to use as much of the fine-grained direct dependency information potentially present in FMI 1.0 (and even more so in FMI 2.0/3.0) as possible, in order to avoid algorithmic loops being detected where they are not really present.

=== Logging Support

Importing implementations should allow fine-grained selection of FMU logging output recording/display, either based on the new FMU-defined logging categories for FMI 2.0/3.0 or on the raw string category argument of the logging callback in FMI 1.0.

Note that since the logging callback type signature in FMI 1.0 and 2.0 uses a variable argument list, this can have implications for the calling convention of that function on platforms that have different calling conventions for C functions with variable argument lists than for functions with fixed argument lists.

Starting with FMI 3.0, the logging callback uses a fixed argument list.

Exporting implementations should support the fine-grained selection of logging categories in FMI 2.0/3.0 and should use fine-grained category names in the category argument for FMI 1.0 logging callback calls.

In FMI 1.0 they should try to not produce verbose logging output when the debug logging flag is false.

=== Handling of Dependency Information

FMI 2.0/3.0 provide comprehensive information about the structure of a model encapsulated as an FMU, as defined in the element `ModelStructure` of the `modelDescription.xml`.

This element defines the dependencies between variables, both during initialization as well as at runtime, which may differ.

The following examples demonstrate in more detail how this information can be understood and used.

==== Example 1

An FMU is defined by the following equations:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{align*}

\frac{d}{\text{dt}}\begin{bmatrix}
x_{1} \\
x_{2} \\
x_{3} \\
\end{bmatrix}

&=

\begin{bmatrix}
f_{1}\left( x_{2} \right) \\
f_{2}\left( x_{1} \right) + 3 \cdot p^{2} \cdot x_{2} + 2 \cdot u_{1} + 3 \cdot u_{3} \\
f_{3}\left( x_{1},x_{3},u_{1},u_{2},u_{3} \right) \\
\end{bmatrix}

\\

y &= g_1(x_2, x_3)

\end{align*}
++++

where latexmath:[{u_{1}}] is a continuous-time input (`variability` = `continuous`), latexmath:[{u_{2}}] is any type of input, latexmath:[{u_{3}}] is a floating-point discrete-time input (`variability` = `discrete`), and latexmath:[{p}] is a fixed parameter (`variability` = `fixed`).

The initialization is defined by:

[latexmath]
++++
x_1 = 1.1, \frac{dx_2}{dt} = 0, y = 3.3,
++++

and therefore, the initialization equations are:

[latexmath]
++++
\begin{align*}
x_{2} &= \frac{1}{3 \cdot p^{2}} \cdot ( f_{2}\left( x_{1} \right) + 2 \cdot u_{1} + 3 \cdot u_{3} )
\\
x_{3} &= g_{1}^{- 1}( x_{2}, y)
\end{align*}
++++

The model structure for this equation system can be defined as:

   <InitialUnknown valueReference="8"/>
   <InitialUnknown valueReference="10"/>
   <InitialUnknown valueReference="11"/>
</ModelStructure>

==== Example 2

An FMU is defined by the following equation:

[latexmath]
++++
y = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
2 \cdot u \ \mathrm{if} \ u > 0 \\
3 \cdot u \ \mathrm{else} \\
\end{matrix}\right.
++++

where latexmath:[{u}] is a continuous-time input with `valueReference` = `1` and latexmath:[{y}] is a continuous-time output with `valueReference` = `2`.

The definition of the model structure is then:

[source, xml]
----
<ModelVariables>
   <Float64 name="u" valueReference= "1" causality="input" start="1"/>
   <Float64 name="y" valueReference= "2" causality="output"/>
</ModelVariables>
<ModelStructure>
  <Output valueReference="2" dependencies="1" dependenciesKind="discrete"/>
  <InitialUnknown valueReference="2"/>
</ModelStructure>
----

Note that latexmath:[{y = d \cdot u}] where latexmath:[{d}] changes only during event mode (latexmath:[{d = 2 \cdot u}] or latexmath:[{3 \cdot u\ }] depending on relation latexmath:[{u > 0}] that changes only at event mode).
Therefore `dependenciesKind` = `discrete`.

==== Example 3

An FMU is defined by the following equation:

[latexmath]
++++
y = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
2\ \ \mathrm{if}\ \ u > 0 \\
3\ \ \mathrm{else} \\
\end{matrix}\right.
++++

where latexmath:[{u}] is a continuous-time input with `valueReference` = `1` and latexmath:[{y}] is a continuous-time output with `valueReference` = `2`.

The definition of the model structure is then:

[source, xml]
----
<ModelVariables>
   <Float64 name="u" valueReference= "1" causality="input" start="1"/>
   <Float64 name="y" valueReference= "2" causality="output"/>
</ModelVariables>
<ModelStructure>
  <Output valueReference="2" dependencies="1" dependenciesKind="dependent"/>
  <InitialUnknown valueReference="2"/>
</ModelStructure>
----

Note that latexmath:[{y = c}] where latexmath:[{c}] changes only during event mode (latexmath:[{c = 2}] or latexmath:[{3\ }] depending on relation latexmath:[{u > 0}] that changes only at event mode).
Therefore `dependenciesKind` = `dependent` because it is not a linear relationship on latexmath:[{u}].

==== Example 4

An FMU is defined by the following equations:

[latexmath]
++++
\frac{dx}{dt}=u, y=x
++++

where latexmath:[{u}] is a continuous-time input with `valueReference` = `1`, latexmath:[{y}] is a continuous-time output with `valueReference` = `2` and latexmath:[{dxdt}] is a continuous-time derivative with `valueReference` = `4`.

The definition of the model structure is then:

[source, xml]
----
<ModelVariables>
   <Float64 name="u" valueReference= "1" causality="input" start="0"/>
   <Float64 name="y" valueReference= "2" causality="output"/>
   <Float64 name="x" valueReference= "3"/>
   <Float64 name="dxdt" valueReference= "4"/>
</ModelVariables>
<ModelStructure>
  <Output valueReference="2" dependencies="3" dependenciesKind="constant"/>
  <ContinuousStateDerivative valueReference="4" dependencies="1" dependenciesKind="constant"/>
  <InitialUnknown valueReference="2" dependencies="3"/>
</ModelStructure>
