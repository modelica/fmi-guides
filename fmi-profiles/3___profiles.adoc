== Feature Profiles

The initial set of use-case-based feature profiles includes a set of five feature profiles, which can be seen in the overview in table <<feature-matrix,Feature Overview>>.
They are described in detail in the following sections.

=== Basic CS Profile

  - Binary FMUs for Desktop Platforms

Recommended Features::
  - Tunable Parameters

- support of certain layerd standards (LS-BUS)

Recommended Features:: 
- support of certain layerd standards (LS-XCP)

=== Dynamics Profile

This is a profile for high dynamics mechatronic simulation, including variable cycle times, model exchange for allowing efficient handling of tightly coupled sub-systems, and the use of advanced co-simulation and model-exchange approaches.

  - State and Output Dependencies
  - Binary FMUs for Desktop Platforms

Recommended Features::
  - Binary Data Type Input/Output
  - Fixed-size Input/Output Arrays
  - Resizable Parameter Arrays
  - Resizable Parameter Arrays with Size-Dependencies
  - Variable Co-Simulation Communication Step Size  (*CS only*)
  - Restartable Early Return in Hybrid Co-Simulation (*CS only*)
  - Output Derivatives in Co-Simulation (*CS only*)

=== Optimization Profile

This is a profile that caters to different but overlapping optimization use cases:
-	Model-predictive control (with the model as an FMU)
-	Parameter identification of a model via optimization
-	Training of ML models (e.g. neural networks) (need for adjoint derivatives, for Backpropagation)

Required Features::
  - Tunable Parameters
  - Store/Restore FMU State
  - Serialize/Deserialize FMU State
  - Fixed-size Input/Output Arrays
  - Fixed-size Parameter Arrays
  - Resizable Parameter Arrays

The support for source code FMUs is not strictly necessary for the Basic CS and Sensor profiles but is highly recommended to support the portability of FMUs to new platforms.

More generally, support for source code FMUs and binary FMUs for desktop and non-desktop platforms is recommended wherever feasible to aid portability and interoperability.
