The support for source code FMUs is not strictly necessary for the Basic CS and Sensor profiles but is highly recommended to support the portability of FMUs to new platforms.

More generally, support for source code FMUs and binary FMUs for desktop and non-desktop platforms is recommended wherever feasible to aid portability and interoperability.
